# Manipulation-of-image-through-CV-and-Pillow
When you need to resize an image to exact dimensions, use resize() in both Pillow and OpenCV. If maintaining the aspect ratio is not required, this method allows for cropping to match specific target dimensions. Use the imutils Python library, a wrapper for OpenCV, to simplify common image manipulations like resizing.
